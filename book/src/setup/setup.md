# Setting up your development environment

The first step in setting up your development environment is making sure you're running Windows. Several of the
important tools for developing code for our robots are unfortunately only available for Windows, so if your personal
laptop runs Linux or MacOS, you'll need to borrow a team laptop, talk to a lead to have this arranged.

## What tools do we use?

Once you have a dev machine (laptop with windows), you need to install the tools that we use. This includes:
- IntelliJ IDEA
- GitHub Desktop
- WPILib
- FRC Game Tools
