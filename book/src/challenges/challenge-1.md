# Challenge 1: Autonomous Differential Drive

Creating a robot program that can drive and turn set amounts with a differential drive robot.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge is designed to test your abilities with simple motor control and feedback loops. Your task is to create
a robot program that controls our differential test bot, and is capable of precisely driving set distances and turning
set angles.

## Completion Criteria

- The robot uses command-based programming.
- The robot has commands for driving a set distance and turning a set angle.
- The robot has a low level of error in both driving and turning (lowest error "wins").

## Conclusion

As you can see the criteria is very simple, but there are MANY things that could be done to improve the robot's
usability and performance. This is where your creativity and problem-solving skills come in. Good luck!
