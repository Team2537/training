# How to do our Kotlin Labs

Each module of Unit 1 has a matching lab that tests your knowledge of what you just learned.
To do each lab you will want to clone this repository, and make a branch titled `firstname_lastname`, replacing with
your actual first and last name.

Once you have your own branch, you'll want to open the project in IntelliJ, and navigate
to `src/main/kotlin/basics/unit1`, and there you will see all five labs. Once you have written the code you can hover
over the `main()` function, and hit the little green play button to the left of it, this will run your code so you can
see if it works properly or not.

Once you finish with each lab, commit to your branch, and ask a software lead or mentor to take a look, and thats it!
