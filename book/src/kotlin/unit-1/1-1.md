# Variables & Operators

In this lesson, you will learn about variables and operators in Kotlin. You will learn how to declare variables, assign
values to variables, and use operators to perform operations on variables.

## What is a Variable?

A variable is a storage location that holds a value. In Kotlin, you can declare a variable using the `var` keyword. The
syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:

```kotlin
var variableName: DataType = value
```

- `var`: keyword used to declare a variable
- `variableName`: name of the variable
- `DataType`: type of the variable
- `=`: assignment operator
- `value`: value assigned to the variable

When you use the `var` keyword to declare a variable, you can change the value of the variable later in the program.

### Example

```kotlin
var number: Int = 10
println(number) // Output: 10
number = 20 // Will not cause an error
println(number) // Output: 20
```

<!-- The concept of comments and their syntax should probably be somewhere in here - better Matthew -->

In the example above, we declare a variable `number` of type `Int` and assign it a value of `10`. We then print the
value of `number`, which is `10`. Next, we assign a new value of `20` to `number`, and print the value of `number`,
which is now `20`.

If you want to declare a variable that cannot be changed later in the program, you can use the `val` keyword. The syntax
for declaring a constant variable is as follows:

```kotlin
val variableName: DataType = value
```

All other aspects of declaring a constant variable are the same as declaring a variable with the `var` keyword.

### Example

```kotlin
val pi: Double = 3.14159
var radius: Double = 5.0

println(pi * radius * radius) // Output: The area of a circle with radius 5.0

radius = 10.0 // Will not cause an error
pi = 3.0 // Will cause an error
```

## Data Types

In Kotlin, variables have data types that specify the type of data they can hold. The following table lists some of the
common data types supported by Kotlin:

| Data Type | Description                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| `Int`     | Whole number, no decimal places |
| `Double`  | Number with ~15 decimal places  |
| `Float`   | Number with ~7 decimal places   |
| `Boolean` | `true` or `false`               |
| `Char`    | Single character                |
| `String`  | Sequence of characters          |

### Example

```kotlin
var age: Int = 16
var pi: Double = 3.14159
var isStudent: Boolean = true
var initial: Char = 'A'
var name: String = "John Doe"

var height: Int = "Five Feet" // Causes an error because the data type is incorrect
var weight = 150 // Kotlin can infer the data type, so you don't need to specify it
```

### Type Inference

When a variable is given a value immediately, with its declaration, the type of the variable will automatically be
chosen, or inferred. However, it is often recommended to specify the data type to avoid confusion.

### Nullability

In Kotlin, variables can be nullable, meaning they can hold a `null` value. To declare a nullable variable, you can use
the `?` operator after the data type. Be careful when using nullable variables, as they can cause unexpected errors if
not handled properly.

### Example

```kotlin
var name: String? = null
println(name) // Output: null
```

## Operators

Operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Kotlin supports a variety of
operators, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on variables and values. The following table lists the
arithmetic operators supported by Kotlin:

| Operator | Description         |
|----------|---------------------|
| `+`      | Addition            |
| `-`      | Subtraction         |
| `*`      | Multiplication      |
| `/`      | Division            |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) |

### Example

```kotlin
var x: Int = 10
var y: Int = 5

println(x + y) // Output: 15
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The following table lists the assignment operators
supported by Kotlin:

| Operator | Description                                                                                                             |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `=`      | Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left                                                              |
| `+=`     | Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left                                                                 |
| `-=`     | Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left                                                          |
| `*=`     | Multiplies the variable on the left by the value on the right                                                           |
| `/=`     | Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right                                                              |
| `%=`     | Assigns the remainder of the division of the variable on the left by the value on the right to the variable on the left |

### Example

```kotlin
var x: Int = 10 // Assigns 10 to x
x += 5 // Adds 5 to x
println(x) // Output: 15
```

### Comparison or Boolean Operators

Comparison or boolean operators are used to compare values and return a boolean (true/false) result. The following table
lists the comparison operators supported by Kotlin:

| Operator | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                 |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             |
| `>`      | Greater than             |
| `<`      | Less than                |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    |

### Example

```kotlin
var x: Int = 10
var y: Int = 5

println(x > y) // Output: true
println(x == y) // Output: false
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions and return a boolean result. The following table
lists the logical operators supported by Kotlin:

| Operator | Description                                |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `&&`     | Returns true if both values are true       |
| `\|\|`   | Returns true if at least one value is true |
| `!`      | Returns true if the value is false         |

### Example

```kotlin
var x: Int = 10
var y: Int = 5

println(x > y && x < 20) // Output: true
println(x > y || x == 5) // Output: true
```

## String Formatting

Although not an operator, string formatting is a useful technique for combining strings and variables. In Kotlin, you
can use string interpolation to insert variables into strings. To use string interpolation, prefix the variable name
with a dollar sign (`$`). You may also enclose the variable name with curly-braces (e.g. `${myVar}`).

### Example

```kotlin
var name: String = "Alice"
var age: Int = 30

println("Name: $name, Age: $age") // Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30
```
