# Functions

Functions allow you to define a block of code that can be executed multiple times with different inputs. In Kotlin, you
can define functions using the `fun` keyword. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:

```kotlin
fun functionName(parameter1: DataType, parameter2: DataType, ...): ReturnType {
    // Code to be executed
    return value
}
```

- `fun`: keyword used to define a function
- `functionName`: name of the function
- Parameters (Same syntax as variables)
    - `parameter1`, `parameter2`, ...: parameters passed to the function
    - `DataType`: type of the parameters
- `ReturnType`: type of the value returned by the function
- `return`: keyword used to return a value from the function
- `value`: value to be returned by the function

### Example

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}

val sum = add(5, 3)
println(sum) // Output: 8
```

In the example above, we define a function `add` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` of type `Int` and returns their
sum. We then call the function with arguments `5` and `3` and store the result in a variable `sum`. Finally, we print
the value of `sum`, which is `8`.

<!-- Moved this up here, as a void function was used in an example before its explanation
    Personally, I think it should have started by explaining void functions, then showed returning functions,
    but I'm not the lead here so eh whatever - better Matthew -->
Functions often return a value using the `return` keyword, but not all of them do. If a function does not return a
value, it has a return type of `Unit`. `Unit` is similar to `void` in other languages and indicates that the function 
does not return anything. Such functions are often used to perform repetitive and common tasks,
such as outputting text with `println()`.

### Example

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String) { // Return type is Unit, no need to specify
    println("Hello, $name!")
}

greet("Alice") // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

In the example above, we define a function `greet` that takes a parameter `name` of type `String` and prints a greeting
message. The return type of the function is `Unit`, which is not explicitly specified. 
For the sake of conciseness, `Unit` is almost always omitted as a return type.

You can also define functions with default values for parameters. This allows you to call the function without providing
values for all parameters. If you do not provide a value for a parameter with a default value, the default value will be
used.

### Example

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String = "World") {
    println("Hello, $name!")
}

greet() // Output: Hello, World!
greet("Alice") // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

In the example above, we define a function `greet` that takes a parameter `name` of type `String` with a default value
of
`"World"`. We then call the function without providing a value for `name`, which uses the default value. We also call
the
function with the argument `"Alice"`, which overrides the default value.

If you have multiple parameters, the ones with default values must come after the ones without default values. You can
also use named arguments to specify the values for parameters with default values.

### Example

```kotlin
fun greet(greeting: String = "Hello", name: String = "World") {
    println("$greeting, $name!")
}

greet() // Output: Hello, World!
greet("Hi") // Output: Hi, World!
greet("Hi", "Alice") // Output: Hi, Alice!
greet(name = "Bob") // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

In the example above, we define a function `greet` with two parameters `greeting` and `name`, both of type `String`,
with default values of `"Hello"` and `"World"`, respectively. We then call the function with different combinations of
arguments and named arguments to see how the default values are used.

Functions can also be defined as expressions using the `=` operator. This allows you to define functions concisely
without using curly braces and the `return` keyword.

### Example

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b

val sum = add(5, 3)
println(sum) // Output: 8
```

In the example above, we define a function `add` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` of type `Int` and returns their
sum. The function is defined as an expression using the `=` operator, which automatically returns the result of the
expression.

## The `main` Function

In Kotlin, the `main` function is the entry point of a Kotlin program. When you run a Kotlin program, the code inside
the
`main` function is executed. The `main` function is defined as follows:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

When you run a Kotlin program, the code inside the `main` function is executed sequentially. You can define other
functions and call them from the `main` function to organize your code.

## Lambdas and First-Class Functions

Before we dive into lambdas, let's first understand what first-class functions are. In Kotlin, functions are considered
first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any other value. You can assign functions to variables,
pass them as arguments to other functions, and return them from other functions.

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b

fun multiply(a: Int, b: Int) = a * b

println(add(multiply(2, 3), 4)) // Output: 10
```

In the example above, we define two functions `add` and `multiply`. We then call `add` with the result of `multiply(2, 3)`
and `4`. This demonstrates how functions can be used as values in Kotlin.

### Lambdas

Lambdas are "anonymous functions", this means that they do not have a name. Lambdas are often used to define small
blocks of code that can be passed as arguments to other functions. The syntax for defining a lambda is as follows:

```kotlin
{ parameter1: DataType, parameter2: DataType, ... -> code }
```

- `{}`: curly braces used to define a lambda
- `parameter1`, `parameter2`, ...: parameters passed to the lambda
- `DataType`: type of the parameters
- `->`: separates the parameters from the code block
- `code`: block of code to be executed

Lambdas can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to functions. They are often used with higher-order
functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments.

### Example

```kotlin
val add: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a + b }

println(add(5, 3)) // Output: 8
```

As you can see, the "type" of the lambda is `(Int, Int) -> Int`, which means it takes two `Int` parameters and returns
an `Int`. The lambda itself is `{ a, b -> a + b }`, which adds the two parameters `a` and `b`.
