# Functions

Functions allow you to define a block of code that can be executed multiple times with different inputs. In Kotlin, you
can define functions using the `fun` keyword. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:

```kotlin
fun functionName(parameter1: DataType, parameter2: DataType, ...): ReturnType {
    // Code to be executed
    return value
}
```

- `fun`: keyword used to define a function
- `functionName`: name of the function
- Parameters (Same syntax as variables)
    - `parameter1`, `parameter2`, ...: parameters passed to the function
    - `DataType`: type of the parameters
- `ReturnType`: type of the value returned by the function
- `return`: keyword used to return a value from the function
- `value`: value to be returned by the function

### Example

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}

val sum = add(5, 3)
println(sum) // Output: 8
```

In the example above, we define a function `add` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` of type `Int` and returns their
sum. We then call the function with arguments `5` and `3` and store the result in a variable `sum`. Finally, we print
the value of `sum`, which is `8`.

<!-- Moved this up here, as a void function was used in an example before its explanation
    Personally, I think it should have started by explaining void functions, then showed returning functions,
    but I'm not the lead here so eh whatever - better Matthew -->
Functions often return a value using the `return` keyword, but not all of them do. If a function does not return a
value, it has a return type of `Unit`. `Unit` is similar to `void` in other languages and indicates that the function 
does not return anything. Such functions are often used to perform repetitive and common tasks,
such as outputting text with `println()`.

### Example

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String) { // Return type is Unit, no need to specify
    println("Hello, $name!")
}

greet("Alice") // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

In the example above, we define a function `greet` that takes a parameter `name` of type `String` and prints a greeting
message. The return type of the function is `Unit`, which is not explicitly specified. 
For the sake of conciseness, `Unit` is almost always omitted as a return type.

You can also define functions with default values for parameters. This allows you to call the function without providing
values for all parameters. If you do not provide a value for a parameter with a default value, the default value will be
used.

### Example

```kotlin
fun greet(name: String = "World") {
    println("Hello, $name!")
}

greet() // Output: Hello, World!
greet("Alice") // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

In the example above, we define a function `greet` that takes a parameter `name` of type `String` with a default value
of
`"World"`. We then call the function without providing a value for `name`, which uses the default value. We also call
the
function with the argument `"Alice"`, which overrides the default value.

If you have multiple parameters, the ones with default values must come after the ones without default values. You can
also use named arguments to specify the values for parameters with default values.

### Example

```kotlin
fun greet(greeting: String = "Hello", name: String = "World") {
    println("$greeting, $name!")
}

greet() // Output: Hello, World!
greet("Hi") // Output: Hi, World!
greet("Hi", "Alice") // Output: Hi, Alice!
greet(name = "Bob") // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

In the example above, we define a function `greet` with two parameters `greeting` and `name`, both of type `String`,
with default values of `"Hello"` and `"World"`, respectively. We then call the function with different combinations of
arguments and named arguments to see how the default values are used.

Functions can also be defined as expressions using the `=` operator. This allows you to define functions concisely
without using curly braces and the `return` keyword.

### Example

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b

val sum = add(5, 3)
println(sum) // Output: 8
```

In the example above, we define a function `add` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` of type `Int` and returns their
sum. The function is defined as an expression using the `=` operator, which automatically returns the result of the
expression.

## The `main` Function

In Kotlin, the `main` function is the entry point of a Kotlin program. When you run a Kotlin program, the code inside
the
`main` function is executed. The `main` function is defined as follows:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

When you run a Kotlin program, the code inside the `main` function is executed sequentially. You can define other
functions and call them from the `main` function to organize your code.

## Lambdas

Lambda expressions (also known as anonymous functions) are a concise way to define functions that can be passed as
arguments to other functions. In Kotlin, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any
other value. This allows you to pass functions as arguments, return functions from other functions, and store functions
in variables.

### Lambda Syntax

Lambda expressions are defined using curly braces `{}` and the `->` operator. The syntax for a lambda expression is as
follows:

```kotlin
{ parameter1: DataType, parameter2: DataType, ... -> 
    // Code to be executed
}
```

- `{}`: curly braces used to define a lambda expression
- `parameter1`, `parameter2`, ...: parameters passed to the lambda expression
- `DataType`: type of the parameters
- `->`: operator used to separate parameters from the code block
- `// Code to be executed`: code block to be executed by the lambda expression
- The last expression in the lambda block is the return value

These lambda expressions can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions, which allows you to
write more concise and expressive code.

### Example

```kotlin
val add: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a + b }
val multiply: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a * b }

fun calculate(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}
```

In the example above, we define two lambda expressions `add` and `multiply` that take two parameters `a` and `b` of type
`Int` and return their sum and product, respectively. We then define a function `calculate` that takes two parameters
`a` and `b` of type `Int` and an operation that is a lambda expression `(Int, Int) -> Int`. The `calculate` function
calls the operation with the given parameters `a` and `b` and returns the result.

You can input any lambda expression that matches the `(Int, Int) -> Int` signature into the `calculate` function, which
allows you to perform different operations on the input values.

A function like `calculate` that takes another function as an argument is known as a higher-order function. Higher-order
functions are a powerful feature of Kotlin that allows you to write more flexible and reusable code.
