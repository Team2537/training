# Logic & Loops

In this lesson, you will learn about "Control Flow" in Kotlin. You will learn how to use conditional statements and
loops to control the flow of your program.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In Kotlin, you can use
the following conditional statements:

- `if` statement
- `if-else` statement
- `when` statement

### `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. The syntax for the `if` statement is as
follows:

```kotlin
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

If the condition is true, the code block inside the curly braces `{}` will be executed. If the condition is false, the
code block will be skipped.

### Example

```kotlin
val number = 10

if (number > 0) {
    println("Number is positive")
}
```

In the example above, we declare a variable `number` with a value of `10`. We then use an `if` statement to check
if `number` is greater than `0`. Since `number` is `10`, the condition is true, and the message "Number is positive"
will be printed.

### `if-else` Statement

The `if-else` statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the
condition is false. The syntax for the `if-else` statement is as follows:

```kotlin
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

If the condition is true, the code block inside the first set of curly braces `{}` will be executed. If the condition is
false, the code block inside the second set of curly braces `{}` will be executed.

### Example

```kotlin
val number = -5

if (number > 0) {
    println("Number is positive")
} else {
    println("Number is negative")
}
```

In the example above, we declare a variable `number` with a value of `-5`. We then use an `if-else` statement to check
if `number` is greater than `0`. Since `number` is `-5`, the condition is false, and the message "Number is negative"
will be printed.

You can also chain multiple `if-else` statements together to check for multiple conditions.

### Example

```kotlin
val number = 0

if (number > 0) {
    println("Number is positive")
} else if (number < 0) {
    println("Number is negative")
} else {
    println("Number is zero")
}
```

In the example above, we declare a variable `number` with a value of `0`. We then use multiple `if-else` statements to
check if `number` is greater than `0`, less than `0`, or equal to `0`. Since `number` is `0`, the message "Number is
zero" will be printed.

### `when` Statement

The `when` statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on a more complex state than true/false.
this is useful when you have multiple conditions to check, so you don't have to chain multiple `if-else` statements.

The syntax for the `when` statement is as follows:

```kotlin
when (variable) {
    value1 -> {
        // Code to be executed if variable equals value1
    }
    value2 -> {
        // Code to be executed if variable equals value2
    }
    else -> {
        // Code to be executed if variable does not equal any of the values
    }
}
```

The `when` statement checks the value of the `variable` and executes the code block corresponding to the value. If
the `variable` does not match any of the values, the code block inside the `else` block will be executed.

### Example

```kotlin

val number = 10

when (number) {
    0 -> println("Number is zero")
    in 1..9 -> println("Number is between 1 and 9")
    else -> println("Number is 10 or greater")
}
```

In the example above, we declare a variable `number` with a value of `10`. We then use a `when` statement to check the
value of `number`. If `number` is `0`, the message "Number is zero" will be printed. If `number` is between `1` and `9`,
the message "Number is between 1 and 9" will be printed. If `number` is `10` or greater, the message "Number is 10 or
greater" will be printed.

## Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. In Kotlin, you can use the following loop structures:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop

But first we need to quickly go over ranges and collections.

### Ranges

You can create a range of numbers by specifying the start and end values separated by the `..` operator. The range
includes the start value and the end value.

```kotlin
val range = 1..5 // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

You can also create a range that counts down by using the `downTo` keyword.

```kotlin
val range = 5 downTo 1 // 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

### Collections

Collections are used to store multiple values. In Kotlin, there are many types of collections, but most of them are for
you to learn about on your own.
For this lesson we will just be talking about lists

A list is an ordered collection of elements. In Kotlin, you can create a list using the `listOf` function.

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

You can access elements in a list using the index of the element.

```kotlin
println(numbers[0]) // Output: 1
```

List indices start at `0`, so the first element in the list has an index of `0`.

### `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a range, collection, or any other type of iterable. The syntax for the `for` loop
is as follows:

```kotlin
for (element in range) {
    // Code to be executed for each element
}
```

The `for` loop will iterate over each element in the range and execute the code block for each element.
the `element` variable will be assigned to the current element in the range.

### Example

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

for (number in numbers) {
    println(number)
}
```

In the example above, we create a list of numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` and use a `for` loop to iterate over each number and
print it to the console.

You can use a shorthand for the for loop by using the `.forEach` function. When doing this you can use the `it` keyword
to refer to the current element.

### Example

```kotlin

val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

numbers.forEach {
    println(it)
}
```

### `while` Loop

The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. The syntax for the `while` loop is
as follows:

```kotlin
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed while the condition is true
}
```

The `while` loop will continue to execute the code block as long as the condition is true.

### Example

```kotlin
var number = 5

while (number > 0) {
    println(number)
    number--
}
```

In the example above, we declare a variable `number` with a value of `5`. We then use a `while` loop to print the value
of `number` and decrement it by `1` until `number` is less than or equal to `0`.

You can also use the `do-while` loop, which is similar to the `while` loop but will always execute the code block at
least once before checking the condition.

### Example

```kotlin
var number = 5

do {
    println(number)
    number--
} while (number > 0)
```

In the example above, we declare a variable `number` with a value of `5`. We then use a `do-while` loop to print the
value of `number` and decrement it by `1` until `number` is less than or equal to `0`.
