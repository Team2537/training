# Methods & Constructors

Methods are a special kind of function that are defined inside a class. They are used to define the behavior of an
object. In Kotlin, methods are defined using the `fun` keyword followed by the method name. The method can take
parameters and return a value. Here is an example of a method that takes two parameters and returns the sum of the two
numbers:

```kotlin
class Calculator {
    fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
        return a + b
    }
}

fun main() {
    val calculator = Calculator()
    val sum = calculator.add(5, 10)
    println(sum) // Output: 15
}
```

In this example, we define a class called `Calculator` with a method called `add`. The `add` method takes two parameters
`a` and `b` of type `Int` and returns the sum of the two numbers. We then create an instance of the `Calculator` class
and call the `add` method with the values `5` and `10`. The result is stored in the `sum` variable and printed to the
console.

## Constructors

Constructors are special methods that are called when an object is created. They are used to initialize the object with
default values or values passed as arguments. In Kotlin, the primary constructor is defined in the class header, and
code is ran using them in the `init` block. Here is an example of a class with a primary constructor:

```kotlin
class Person(name: String, age: Int) {
    init {
        println("Name: $name")
        println("Age: $age")
    }
}
```

But now we have a problem. We can't access the `name` and `age` properties outside of the `init` block. To fix this, we
can define properties in the class header and initialize them using the primary constructor, the same way you can
declare normal properties:

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
    init {
        println("Name: $name")
        println("Age: $age")
    }
}
```

So now we can access the `name` and `age` properties outside of the `init` block. Here is an example of creating a
`Person` object with a name and age:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val person = Person("Alice", 30)
    println(person.name) // Output: Alice
    println(person.age) // Output: 30
}
```

In this example, we create a `Person` object with the name "Alice" and age `30`. We then print the `name` and `age`
properties of the `person` object using the `println` function.

## Secondary Constructors

In addition to the primary constructor, you can define secondary constructors in a class. Secondary constructors are
defined using the `constructor` keyword and can have different parameter lists than the primary constructor. Here is an
example of a class with a secondary constructor:

```kotlin
class Person {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int = 0

    constructor(name: String, age: Int) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a class called `Person` with two properties `name` and `age`. We then define a secondary
constructor that takes a `name` and `age` parameter and assigns them to the properties. This also uses the `this`
keyword which is used to refer to the current object from within itself, as you can not declare properties within the
parameters of a secondary constructor.
